# REGIME CONSTITUCIONAL DO ATLAS

## Source of Authority

The Atlas is the sole constitutional authority.
This system executes only what has been deemed admissible upstream.
If a conflict arises, Atlas prevails.

## Coordination Protocol

The deploy circuit behaves as a coordination protocol between constitutional authority and runtime execution.
It guarantees that no state transition occurs without:
- admissibility
- deterministic execution
- cryptographic evidence

## Ghost State

Ghost State is considered a structural violation.
Evidence without materialized state is invalid.
Materialized state without evidence is unauthorized.

## Scope Boundary

The deploy circuit must remain operationally narrow.
It is not a platform.
It is not a workflow engine.
It is not a generalized orchestrator.
Scope expansion is treated as architectural risk.

## Deterministic Execution Protocol

Toda referência a "execution circuit" foi renomeada para "deterministic execution protocol".
Sem exceção.

## Architectural Rigidity

Modo de rigidez arquitetural ativado até checklist completo.
Nenhuma nova superfície. Nenhuma feature. Apenas endurecer.
